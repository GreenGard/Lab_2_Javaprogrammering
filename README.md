### Assignment
In this laboratory, we will model a simple system for keeping products in order. It can
either be goods that are for sale in some type of store where it can be in, for example, a grocery store
wide spread on the type of goods or products that are manufactured in any industry and thus may be of
roughly the same variety but with special characteristics.
Think through what classes might be needed to implement the following:
Goods that may contain a name, regular price and which category(s) it belongs to and the brand
for the product as well as some form of product time, which can for example be an ean code (bar code).
Categories will vary with the type of goods our system should be able to handle and should be
flexible. It should therefore be possible to create new categories in the future. If we think of food, we can
categories such as fruit, dry goods, meat, frozen goods.
The program must be able to manage stock balances for various products where there is a storage of which goods we
have in stock and how many of that particular item.
We also want to be able to search the program for, for example, goods within a certain price range, goods such as
belongs to a certain category, etc. For this we conveniently use Java Streams.
Storage of objects in our program is conveniently done with Java's built-in classes for Collections or Map.
